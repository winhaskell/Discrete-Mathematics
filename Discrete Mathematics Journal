Discrete Mathematics provides a common forum for significant research in many areas of discrete mathematics and combinatorics.

The research areas covered by Discrete Mathematics include graph and hypergraph theory, enumeration, coding theory, block designs, 
the combinatorics of partially ordered sets, extremal set theory, matroid theory, algebraic combinatorics, discrete geometry, matrices, 
discrete probability, and parts of cryptography.

Discrete Mathematics generally does not include research on dynamical systems, differential equations, or discrete Laplacian operators 
within its scope. It also does not publish articles that are principally focused on linear algebra, abstract algebraic structures, 
or fuzzy sets unless they are highly related to one of the main areas of interest. Also, papers focused primarily on applied problems or
experimental results fall outside our scope.

Items in the journal include research articles (Contributions or Notes, depending on length) and survey/expository articles (Perspectives). 
Efforts are made to process the submission of Notes (short articles) quickly. The Perspectives section features expository articles accessible
to a broad audience that cast new light or present unifying points of view on well-known or insufficiently-known topics.

Discrete Mathematics also publishes occasional Special Issues containing selected papers. Such issues are fully refereed and
adhere to the normal high standards of the journal.
