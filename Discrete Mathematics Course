Discrete Mathematics 2023 
https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~lyuu/dm.html

To the students,

This course is on discrete mathematics. It covers combinatorics, boolean logic, computation theory, analysis of algorithms, 
probability, algebra, number theory, graph theory, set theory, and many other fields. 

Parts of the book should have been covered in high school and will be skipped or only briefly reviewed. 
I have in mind basic combinatorics, logic, and basic set theory.

It is never an easy job to teach discrete mathematics, because it touches so many areas of learning. 
Furthermore, unlike algebra, discrete mathematics does not seem to have a structure that can be said to form its foundation. 
But, for precisely the same reason, the subject is fascinating.

Please note that this course will be taught in English.
