Discrete mathematics provides the language and abstractions required to reason about many concepts in computer science. 
Most topics studied in a high school mathematics curriculum (such algebra, trigonomtry, and calculus) are concerned with 
continuous phenomena. These subjects form the foundation for the physical sciences and engineering. Discrete mathematics, 
on the other hand, underlies the science and technology of the computer age. Discrete mathematics is concerned with 
mathematical structures that are composed of distinct pieces or processes that are composed of individual steps. 
Since the native language of computers is expressed in binary (0's and 1's), it is natural that the formalism 
we use to describe them is discrete mathematics.

In this course, you will learn the mathematical tools to solve certain classes of problems, such as how to prove a 
recursive algorithm computes the correct value, how to encode messages using commonly used cryptographic protocols,
or how to calculate the probability of events in discrete structures. In addition, you will expand your mathematical 
language so that when you encounter new problems in computer science, you will have the tools to describe, analyze 
and understand those problems.
